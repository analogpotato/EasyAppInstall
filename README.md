# EasyAppInstall

## üòÄ Purpose

"EasyAppInstall" is a tool created to simplify and automate the process of installing your favorite applications on a new machine. Whether you're a developer, a system admin, or an individual user, this project is designed with you in mind. Utilizing the power of package managers - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for macOS and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for Windows 10/11 - it automates not only the installation of a suite of applications but also ensures the package managers themselves are installed, offering a near one-click solution.

What sets EasyAppInstall apart is its flexibility and modularity. The list of applications to be installed is maintained in a simple text file, packages.txt, which can be easily customized according to each user's needs. Want to maintain your own list of packages in a remote location? The script can prompt for a custom URL to your packages.txt file. In essence, EasyAppInstall makes setting up your essential software a breeze, regardless of whether you're on a Mac or Windows machine.

## üìÉ Features
- **Cross-Platform Support:** The scripts provided in this repository are designed to work on both Windows (using PowerShell and Chocolatey) and macOS (using zsh and Homebrew), allowing for easy package installation on either platform.

- **Easy Package Configuration:** Packages to be installed are listed in a simple text file (packages.txt), making it easy for users to customize which packages are installed by the script. Users can fork the repository and modify this file to suit their needs.

- **Automatic Package Manager Installation:** If the required package manager (Chocolatey or Homebrew) is not already installed on the system, the script will automatically download and install it.

- **Package Installation:** The script automatically installs a list of software packages on the user's system. On Windows, it uses Chocolatey to install the packages, and on macOS, it uses Homebrew.

- **User URL Input:** The PowerShell script prompts the user to enter a URL for their own packages.txt file if they wish, allowing users to maintain their own list of packages in a remote location.

- **GitHub URL Parsing:** If a user provides a URL to a packages.txt file on GitHub, the PowerShell script can parse it from a standard GitHub URL to a raw.githubusercontent.com URL suitable for direct file download.

- **Skip Already Installed Packages:** The scripts check whether each package is already installed before attempting installation, avoiding unnecessary operations.

- **One-Click/One-Line Execution:** The scripts can be downloaded and executed in a single line of code, making it easy for users to run.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to use EasyAppInstall

### For Windows:

1. **Open PowerShell:** Right-click the start button and select "Windows PowerShell" from the context menu. If you see "Command Prompt" instead of "Windows PowerShell", you can choose that.

2. **Run the Script:** Copy and paste the following command into PowerShell and press Enter:

```
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogpotato/EasyAppInstall/main/chocolatey/install.ps1 | iex
```

When prompted, enter the URL to your own packages.txt file hosted on Github if you have one, or press Enter to use the default located in the `/chocolatey/packages.txt` folder in this repo.

### For macOS:

1. **Open Terminal:** You can do this by searching for "Terminal" in Spotlight (the magnifying glass in the top-right corner of the screen).

2. **Run the Script:** Copy and paste the following command into Terminal and press Enter:

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogpotato/EasyAppInstall/main/brew/install.sh -o ~/install.sh && chmod +x ~/install.sh && ~/install.sh
```
- ‚ùó**Attention!** If you want to update the package list provided, then you may have to fork this repo and update the `packages` list before running.

That's it! The script will automatically install the listed packages using the appropriate package manager (Chocolatey for Windows, Homebrew for macOS). If the package manager is not already installed, the script will install it first. If you provided a custom packages.txt file, the script will install the packages listed in that file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current issues

- The MacOS script currently doesn't support an alternative Github link, I'm working to fix that.
- More error handling is needed, I'm very green to this kind of scripting üòÖ
